# CS121Project3

For this project, you will develop a game program called Stick, Water. Fire- a version of the
game Rock, Paper, Scissors. The user plays against the computer. You will use conditional
expressions in several ways in this project. Primarily, you will write code to implement the game
rules using conditional statements. You will also utilize Java’s Random class to generate random
outcomes used in the game for the computer’s choice. The Random class can be seeded so
that development and testing can be more easily done. Another aspect of this project is the use
of a private method in a class. Private methods are used only within a class to help other
methods with their calculations.

# Learning Goals:

● Work with multi-file Java projects.
● Write instance variables and methods.
● Use a private method in a class.
● Work with conditionals.
● Work with the Random class.
● Learn and use String methods
● Practice testing and using the JGrasp debugger.
